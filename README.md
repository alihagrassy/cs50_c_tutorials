# cs50_c_tutorials
this is my cs50 C tutorials 
note that you need to have cs50.c and cs50.h to be able to compile your code without error
when you are trying to compile your code in wsl(Windows Subsystem for Linux) and you try to compile it you need to do this :
# cc <name_ofCfile.c> -o <name of make file> cs50.c 
 # example:
  cc debug.c -o debug cs50.c
